# git-hooks Specification

## Purpose
TBD - created by archiving change git-hooks. Update Purpose after archive.
## Requirements
### Requirement: Local Git hooks run on commit and push

The system SHALL install Husky.Net hooks automatically so that commits fail on formatting drift and pushes fail on build errors.

#### Scenario: Automatic install
- **WHEN** a contributor restores the project on a fresh clone
- **THEN** the Husky hooks are installed without manual setup

#### Scenario: Commit blocked on format
- **WHEN** a contributor commits code that deviates from the configured formatting
- **THEN** the commit is blocked with a format error

#### Scenario: Push blocked on build
- **WHEN** a contributor pushes code that does not build cleanly under warnings-as-errors
- **THEN** the push is blocked with a build error
